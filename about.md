I created this website to scratch my itch on spinning up a new Jekyll-based static website. I'm piggybacking off my personal interest on how a low-carb dietary intervention has dramatically help me improve my health and make my lower frequency of eating more delicious. 

I also am blessed in marriage to my amazing chef of a wife. She loves to cook in a way that echoes how Michelangelo  loved to paint. Her culinary talents have made low-carb easy for me, even if she is not low-carb herself.
