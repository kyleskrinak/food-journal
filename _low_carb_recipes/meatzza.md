A long time family favorite. Mrs. Screenack originally found this on fastpaleo.com, but that site is no longer with us. You can see archive.org version [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20150329084558/http://fastpaleo.com/recipe/meatzza/). She has doubled the original recipe, values shown below.

## Ingredients
* 2 lb ground beef
* 2 large egg
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 can chopped tomatoes
* 6 Tbsps grated Parmesan
* 8 oz mozzarella, thinly sliced
* 2 tsp oregano
* handful of fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped
* 6 Tbsp flax seeds

## Instructions

1. Combine the mince, cheese, egg, oregano, flax seeds and garlic together in a large mixing bowl (I used my hands, it’s unpleasant but gets the job done).
1. Press into a circular greased pan or dish, pressing down firmly with your hands until it forms an even ‘crust.’ 
1. Drain the tomatoes very well until all moisture is wrung out of them. Place them on top of the meat in a uniform layer.
1. Top with mozzarella slices and bake in the oven at 420 for 25 minutes.
Remove from oven and let it rest a minute before spreading the basil leaves on top and serving.
