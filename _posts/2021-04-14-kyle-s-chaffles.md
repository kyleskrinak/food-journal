By "Screenack's," I mean very simple and easy to make. I have an 8" double-sided waffle maker that's showing the wear from tens of thousands of wheat waffles I've made in the past. This makes 5 8" chaffles.

## Ingredients
* 8 eggs
* 8 oz Parmesan cheese wedge
* 1.75 oz unprocessed pork rinds (The Aldi pork rinds package is 3.5 oz so half of that)
* 1 T baking soda

* Start warming the waffle iron
* Scramble the eggs, set aside
* Process the Parmesan down. Then add the pork rinds to processor. While the rinds are still course, add the baking soda to mix all three ingredients evenly.
* Once you've ground down the large rinds to an even granular consistency, pour into the eggs and mix.
* Set aside for 5 minutes.
* Pour into waffle iron. My iron makes an audible sound that rings depending on your setting. Chaffles need more heat than waffles, so I set it to max and then add one minute.

That's it!
